# SMB-Android-Books-Rental
This Android project was created as part of the SMB (Mobile Systems Development) course at PJATK. Its primary goal was to fulfill the following requirements:

- Implement at least 3 activities with navigation between them, including at least one list view. You may also use fragments.
- Use a local database (SQLite) and either SharedPreferences or DataStore to store application settings.
- Utilize a Service for background tasks.
- Implement a BroadcastReceiver to capture and respond to system events (at least one). Ensure this component has the necessary permissions to receive broadcasts.
- Migrate the application's backend (database at a minimum) to the cloud, for example, using App Engine or Firebase. Implement authentication.
- Define locations and associated geofences. Users should be able to add new locations and view them on a map. When entering or leaving a location, the app should notify the user with a notification in the status bar.
- Create a Widget for the home screen with shortcuts to our application.
- Incorporate multimedia features, such as MediaPlayer.

Optional/alternative features (you may replace some of the above requirements):

- Share application data through a ContentProvider.
- Add a map displaying the nearest location from the list of available locations.
- Utilize WebRTC functionality.
- Utilize a library for Augmented Reality, e.g., Google ARCore.
- Use contextual information (e.g., from sensors) beyond location.


## Additional Notes

It's worth noting that the combination of features and requirements in this project was quite extensive. In fact, it can be challenging to envision a real-world application that would naturally require all these features.
